== Analysis and Modeling tool for layered photoshop documents
This web application has two main goals:
* create a modular layer based model of the paintings
* implement behavioral algorithms by leveraging the layered model

The pantings are realized as large photoshop documents, with a large amount of layers, loosely organized and without any structural convention.
Once the first Cinder prototype was created, it became clear that some hierarchical structure was required to organize all these layers in order to facilitate and automate their rendering in a real time environment.
Figures consist of a number of grouped layers, and 


The proposed model is a hierarchical tree structure in the first place, leveraging a series of simple rules in order to e a failry deep and complex organization

Once this structure is established, additional functionality will be added in order to view this model from a different perspective
and allow a better analysis of the painting and its potential behavior
The application is not only concerned in 2d modeling and adding a timeline, but also allowing to create unforseen connection between the different parts of the piece
